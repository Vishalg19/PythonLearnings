Solution:   
          class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        nums1.extend(nums2)
        nums1 = sorted(nums1)
        n = len(nums1)
        if n%2 != 0:
            return nums1[n//2]
        else:
            return (nums1[n//2] + nums1[n//2 -1])/2


2nd Question: Print numbers from 1 to 10
Solution:
          print("Print numbers from 1 to 10")
          i=1
          while(i<=10):
              print(i)
              i+=1

3rd Question: Sum of numbers from 1 to 10:
Solution:
          print("Sum of numbers from 1 to 10")
          i,sum = 1,0
          while(i<=10):
              sum = sum +i
              i+=1

Learning: Summary:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around classes and objects.
Classes define attributes (data) and methods (functions).
Objects are instances of classes, representing concrete entities.
Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes.
OOP promotes encapsulation, polymorphism, and code reuse, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
